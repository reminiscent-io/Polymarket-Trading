Here's how I'd frame it for an AI coding assistant:

## Project Overview

Build a **Polymarket insider trading detection dashboard** that analyzes on-chain data to identify suspicious betting patterns indicating potential information asymmetry.

## Core Functionality

**Data Pipeline:**
- Pull transaction data from Polygon blockchain for Polymarket contracts
- Track wallet addresses, bet sizes, timestamps, market outcomes
- Store historical data for pattern analysis (PostgreSQL or similar)

**Detection Algorithm:**
Create a risk scoring system that flags wallets based on:
- Account age vs. position size (new accounts with large bets score higher)
- Win rate on early bets (>70% accuracy in first 5 bets is suspicious)
- Portfolio concentration (single market >60% of capital)
- Timing proximity to outcome resolution (<72 hours)
- Price impact tolerance (accepting unfavorable slippage suggests urgency)

**Dashboard UI:**
- Real-time feed of flagged suspicious wallets with risk scores
- Wallet detail view: full transaction history, markets entered, timing analysis
- Market-level view: which markets are attracting suspicious whale activity
- Historical leaderboard: wallets with highest insider probability scores that won

## Technical Stack Suggestion

**Backend:** Node.js or Python
- Ethers.js/Web3.py for blockchain queries
- Scheduled jobs to poll new transactions every 15 minutes
- RESTful API serving scored wallet data

**Frontend:** React + data viz library (Recharts, D3)
- Real-time updating table of flagged wallets
- Interactive charts showing bet timing vs. event resolution
- Filterable by market category, risk score, position size

**Data:** 
- Polymarket uses Polygon mainnet
- Contract addresses are public, transactions queryable via Polygonscan API or direct RPC
- You'll need to decode transaction data to extract bet details

## Key Edge Cases

- Distinguish between insiders and legitimately skilled analysts
- Handle wallets that split positions across multiple addresses
- Account for market makers vs. directional traders
- Flag coordinated activity (multiple new wallets betting same direction)

## MVP Scope

Start with: scrape last 30 days of Polymarket data, implement basic risk scoring (wallet age + position size + win rate), display top 20 suspicious wallets in a simple table. Build from there.

The interesting part is tuning the scoring algorithm - you'll likely need to iterate based on what patterns actually correlate with proven insider cases.
